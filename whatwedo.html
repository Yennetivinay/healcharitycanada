                        and Outside the Classroom. Heal has condensed India’s traditional six-day schooling into five
                        days, so children can spend Saturdays nurturing their talents and pursuing their hobbies.</h1>
                    <p style="color: #181853;font-size: 18px;">Participating in these activities fosters the children’s
                        emotional well-being and helps develop their self-esteem. As Heal children’s self-confidence
                        grows, by developing their skills and talents, their aspirations for escaping the poverty trap
                        also grow. The Heal family takes great pride in the ways that Heal children showcase their many
                        talents! Here are highlights of activities that they explore on campus:</p>

                            <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 18px;">We stimulate interested students’ love for
                                science by expanding beyond the classroom. The club stimulates the students by training
                                in the scientific method, developing problem solving, and fostering exploration and
                                creative habits. Students participate in science projects individually and in groups,
                                prepare for science fairs, preparecharts and models, conduct scientific experiments,
                                among other activities. Students also read and discuss scientific literature that
                                advances their classroom learning. By working on science projects, they become aware of
                                career options in the scientific world</p>

                                by a student team, called the Aaga Force. The team ensures nothing is wasted at Heal
                                Paradise. Each month, they open a tank, collect 100 kgs manure output per tank, and use
                                the compost to organically fertilize our Heal’s gardens. They have created a
                                revenue-generating model by selling compost bags to visitors and at exhibitions as part
                                of its ‘Garbage to Garden’ initiative. Additionally, there are recycling and composting
                                bins throughout the campus to instill the importance of taking care of Heal’s waste.</p>
